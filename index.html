<h1>CAFE LIBRARY</h1>
<p><h3>ENJOY YOUR COFFEE WITH A BOOK</h3></p>

<p>
    <h4>Books are the open door to whole new other world and other universes!<br>
    When reading a book the reader relaxes and transfers into the world created by the author,<br> visulising it in his own way with his own imaginantion.<br>
    We are the Cafe Library and <br>
    We are the bridge between our world and the world of the books we offer with our coffee.<br>
    Come to our Cafe Library and cross that bridge!<br>
    Become a member so you can always continue your journey<br> to the universe of your favourite book where you left from!
